# 3D_Visualization_API
This work presents a proof of concept for the paper "Learning a Neural 3D Texture Space from 2D Exemplars" in which a model was presented to learn how to retrieve texture parameters from real-world texture pictures. In particular, this project includes designing a real-time rendering environment that can be used to generate an appropriate texture and to paint a shape with that texture. In addition, this project includes the optimisation of the original model presented in the aforementioned paper.

To face the realization of this project, a deep knowledge of several concepts such as Perlin Noise, Ray tracing and Neural Networks was necessary.

The demo of this project can be found [here](https://sara2cb.github.io/dynamicTexture_demo/). In the "test" folder there are some images to test the texture feature. The construction of the model was created in Google Colab and can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bEiF75G03oXbDv9kfu9LX14wE03qpaRc?usp=sharing).
